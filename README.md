# Face-Recognition-in-Python
A real time face recognition system developed in Python using Pillow, OpenCV and NumPy 

The steps to run this project are as follows:
1. Create two folder in the face recognition named 'dataset','trainer'.
2. Run 1st file "face dataset.py" and enter id 1.
3. Again run "face dataset.py" with user id 2 with another face.
4. Run file "2. face training.py" and then further run file "3. face recognition.py".
5. Open 3. face recognition file and edit name according to your need.
6. Run the 3.facerecognition file ,The face recognition works.

For more than 2 faces to be recognized change the id number from 2 to any other greater number desired in file "3. face recognition.py".

Thanks!!
